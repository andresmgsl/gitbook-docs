# 4. Roots and Fills

{% hint style="info" %}
This "Learning Frontity" guide is intended to be read in order so please start from the [first section](settings.md) if you haven't done so already.
{% endhint %}

## Roots

Each package has the opportunity to include any number of React nodes in the final HTML.

We finished the [Packages](packages.md) section with an example of package export that contained a `root` like this:

{% code title="/packages/my-awesome-theme/src/index.js" %}

```javascript
import MyAwesomeTheme from "./components";

export default {
  roots: {
    theme: MyAwesomeTheme,
  },
};
```

{% endcode %}

Usually, a React app injects it's code in a `<div>` of the body, like this:

{% code title="/index.HTML (rendered by Frontity)" %}

```markup
<html>
  <head>...</head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">
      <!-- REACT IS INJECTED HERE -->
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

{% endcode %}

**Frontity** uses that `<div id="root">` to inject the roots of all the packages that are installed:

{% code title="/index.HTML (rendered by Frontity)" %}

```jsx
<html>
  <head>...</head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">
      <MyAwesomeTheme />
      <ShareModal />
      <YetAnotherPackage />
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

{% endcode %}

Most of the time only your `theme` will export a **root**, but if any other package needs something in the DOM, it can include it also.
For example, let's imagine a _ShareModal_ package that has a modal like this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/blog-frontity-org%20%281%29.jpg)

This package can export the React elements it needs in its **root** and expose an action like `actions.share.openModal()` to interact with the theme.

The **root** could be something like this:

{% code title="/packages/my-share-modal-package/src/components/index.js" %}

```jsx
const ShareRoot = ({ state }) => state.share.isModalOpen && <ShareModal />;
export default ShareRoot;
```

{% endcode %}

And the rest of the package something like this:

{% code title="/packages/my-share-modal-package/src/index.js" %}

```javascript
import ShareRoot from "./components/";

export default {
    roots: {
        share: ShareRoot;
    },
    state: {
        share: {
            isModalOpen: false
        }
    },
    actions: {
        share: {
            openModal: ({ state, actions }) => {
                state.share.isModalOpen = true;
            },
            closeModal: ({ state }) => {
                state.share.isModalOpen = false;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

{% endcode %}

Then the only thing the theme would have to do if they want to include share functionality is to check if there's a `share` package and if there is, use its `actions.share.openModal()` action when appropriate.
For example in these buttons:

![](../.gitbook/assets/blog%20%281%29.jpg)

I hope you're starting to see how extensibility works in **Frontity**, but don't worry too much now, we'll talk in more detail later.

By the way, **Frontity** has an API to modify the `<head>` element inside React using the `<Head>` component like this:

```jsx
import { Head } from "frontity";

const MyPackage = () => (
  <Head>
    <title>The title of the page</title>
    <link rel="canonical" href="http://mysite.com/example" />
    <meta name="description" content="Some description" />
  </Head>
);
```

So even though **Frontity** only allows packages to insert React nodes in the `<div id="root">` of the body, they can also modify the `<head>` by adding tags inside a `<Head>`.

For a more detailed explanation you can check [Head page](head.md).

## Fills

**Frontity** uses an extensibility pattern called **Slot and Fill** to extend your themes.
It works like this:

1. In your theme, you include **Slots** where other packages can place content

```jsx
import { Slot } from "frontity";

const Menu = () => (
  <div>
    <Slot name="before menu" />
    <MenuItems />
    <Slot name="after menu" />
  </div>
);
```

2. In your packages, export **Fills** to fill up those spaces:

```jsx
import { Fill } from "frontity";

const AdSenseFills = () => (
  <>
    <Fill name="before menu">
      <AdSense slot="1234" />
    </Fill>

    <Fill name="after menu">
      <AdSense slot="5678" />
    </Fill>
  </>
);
```

Finally, export the **Fills** in your package export like this:

{% code title="/packages/my-adsense-ads/src/index.js" %}

```javascript
import AdSenseFills from "./components/fills";

export default {
  fills: {
    adsense: <AdSenseFills />,
  },
};
```

{% endcode %}

Frontity will insert them after the **roots** to ensure they work correctly:

{% code title="/index.HTML (rendered by Frontity)" %}

```markup
<html>
  <head>...</head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">
      <!-- ROOTS -->
      <MyAwesomeTheme />
      <!-- FILLS -->
      <AdSenseFills />
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

{% endcode %}

The components `<Slot>` and `<Fill>` know about each other so everything ends up in the correct place once the final HTML is generated :)

![Fills get inserted where they find a Slot with the same name.](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-06-03-at-12.08.01.png)

## `useFills` hook

In order to simplify the usage of the Slot and Fill pattern, frontity also provides a [react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) API for creating slot components and "filling" them.

As a frontity theme creator, you can create **"Slots"** that the users of your theme can later fill in with their own content. Here's an example:

Let's say that you want to create a theme where your users can place cat pictures in-between a list of menuItems. Your users will put their `Cat` components in the state like:

{% code title="/my-frontity-package/index.js" %}

```js
export default {
  name: "my-frontity-package",
  state: {
    fills: {
      // The name of the fill has to be unique!
      "cat fill 1": {
        slot: "cat slot",
        library: "RegularCatComponent",
        props: {
          likesBoxes: true,
        },
      },

      "cat fill 2": {
        // This is the same name as for `cat fill 1` because
        // we can have more than one fill for the same slot!
        slot: "cat slot",
        library: "WeirdCatComponent",
        priority: 20, // Optional, Default priority is 10.
        props: {
          likesBoxes: false,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

{% endcode %}
